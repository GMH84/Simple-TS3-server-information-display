Simple TS3 server information display
A program to display simple TeamSpeak server information and users on the server (even queries) in a list.
This program is quite simple with the method of connecting to the server via Socket and with the help of ServerAdmin, which is tested and works, but you need to have access to the username and password of the server query.
I hope it helps you to build your own great program, so start now ðŸ˜‰
